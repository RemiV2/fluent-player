# HTML5 Video Player

*by [RÃ©mi de Juvigny](http://remi.space)*

## Inspiration

* **Keyboard shortcuts** are the same as on YouTube:
  * `Space` or `K` to pause
  * `Left` and `right` arrow keys to skip and go back by 5 seconds
  * `J` and `L` to skip and go back by 10 seconds
  * `F` to ~~pay respect~~ toggle fullscreen

* **Design** : Inspired by Microsoft's [Fluent Design System](https://fluent.microsoft.com/), and Apple's QuickTime Player
